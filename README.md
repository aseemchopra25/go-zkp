# Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof using discrete log over prime number cyclic group 

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8235

- This can be made non-interactive using Fiat-Shamir Transformation and using a secure cryptographic hash function to issue the challenge instead; TODO
- No interaction is necessary between prover and verifier

## Assumptions

- Fp is a finite field of p elements where p is prime
- E(Fp) is an elliptic curve over Fp
- P is a very large prime number over the curve representing our private key value
- G is a generator point over the curve that serves as a generator for the subgroup E(Fp) of prime order n
- Cofactor H is ignored for secp256k1 EC


## Algorithm 
TODO: Add Fiat Shamir Transformation

### Prover

- Create Keypair
- Create Random
- Create Challenge
- Compute r 
- Send r and Pubkey to Verifier


### Verifier

- Verify Pubkey of Prover
- Verify Proof



# Some Research

## Elliptic Curve Secp256k1
- p = (2^256)-(2^32)–(2^9)–(2^8)–(2^7)–(2^6)–(2^4) -(1)

## Zero Knowledge Proofs 
- Zero knowledge proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow a prover to prove that they have some knowledge of a certain kind, without revealing any additional information about that knowledge
- Digital Signatures are a bit like zkp
- A ZKPOK or Zero Knowledge Proof of Knowledge scheme for a particular language consists of a prover and verifier satisying the following properties:
    - Correctness
    - Zero Knowledge
    - Proof of Knowledge
- Sigma Protocol for knowledge of discrete log
    - ZKPOK{(a): g^a = A}
    - Here g is the geenrator of a group G of prime order p 
    - TODO: Check Fiat Shamir transformation to simplify Sigma Protocol
- Sigma protocol can be modified to a digital signature scheme by using Schnorr Signature scheme
- Cyclic groups are generated by a single element G = <x>
